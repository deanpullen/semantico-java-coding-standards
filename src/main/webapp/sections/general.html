<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    This document contains conventions, rules and guidelines on how Semantico developed products should be coded, formatted and styled.
</p>

<p>This document's primary motivation is two- fold: <tt>1)</tt> code consistency and <tt>2)</tt> best practices. By maintaining consistency in coding styles and conventions, we can ease the burden of legacy code maintenance, and mitigate risk of breakage in the future. By adhering to best practices, we ensure optimized, readable, maintainable code.</p>

		<h1>General Guidelines</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is the third major component of a web page. JavaScript code, when properly applied to a web page, enhances the overall user and browser-based experience through attaching to events and controlling the overall behavior layer.</p>
        <p>JavaScript has seen an explosion in popularity in recent years as powerful new browser implementations have finally empowered the creation of full on browser-based web applications. Additionally, careful use of JavaScript allows for full manipulation and control over the other two components of web page authoring, <a href="#markup">HTML Markup</a> and <a href="#css">CSS</a>. Today the structure of pages and the visual styles of pages can be manipulated real time without full web page refreshes.</p>

	<h2>Pillars of Front-end Development</h2>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Separation of presentation, content, and behavior.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/technical/semantic_markup.shtml">Markup should be well-formed, semantically correct</a> and <a href="#validation">generally valid</a>.</li>
		<li><a href="http://icant.co.uk/articles/pragmatic-progressive-enhancement/">Javascript should progressively enhance the experience</a>.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h2>General Practices</h2>
	
	<h3>Indentation</h3>
	
	<p>For all code languages, we require indentation to be done via soft tabs (using the space character). Hitting <em>Tab</em> in your text editor shall be equivalent to <b>four spaces</b>.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Readability vs Compression</h3>
	
	<p>We prefer readability over file-size savings when it comes to maintaining existing files. Plenty of whitespace is encouraged, along with ASCII art, where appropriate. There is no need for any developer to purposefully compress HTML or CSS, nor obfuscate JavaScript.</p>
	
	<p>We will use server-side or build processes to automatically minify and gzip all static client-side files, such as CSS and JavaScript.</p>
